## Reflection

### What is exponential growth, and in the context of the epidemic, what is useful about a generic graph like we see in problem 1?


### What API endpoint did you choose, and why are you interested in that particular data?

### Can you explain in your own words why we need all those `.then()` lines in our `fetch` commands?
(that is, why do we need this stuff:

``` javascript
fetch(url)
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(json => {
     // ... stuff ...
     })
```

### What challenges did you encounter in drawing the chart from the fetched data?
